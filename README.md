#Java-Constructors
What is a constructor
Constructor is also a method but a SPECIAL method
But why that is Special? Lets find out....

When creating a constructor the name must be same as the class name.
In this case constructor name should be Main as it is the class name.
Constructor method does not have a return type such as void, int, String

constructors are used for initialize objects. the initialization may be with user given values
or default values. The constructor is used to assign values to the variables while creating the object.
